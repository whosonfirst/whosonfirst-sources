### Zetashapes

Properties with the `zs` prefix are from Zetashapes.

**Examples:** If we source our default geometry from Zetashapes we say that in `src:geom: zetashapes`. We list which US Census Blocks compose the Zetashapes geometry in `zs:blockids`, and a few other properties like `zs:pop10` for population count.

Zetashapes polygons and data are subject to the following:
