### Mesoshapes

Properties with the `meso` prefix are from Mesoshapes.

**Examples:** `meso:name_local` for the localized name of a place. `meso:type_loc` for the localized placetype of a feature (simple commune, prefecture, region).

Who's on First doesn't always use the Mesoshapes geometry, so review that in `src:geom`. When we do, some Mesoshapes features source from friendly CC0 or Public Domain licensed projects, and others from a stricter CC-BY project: check that in the `meso:source` property. Features sourced from mesoshapes generally fall in the `locality`, `county`, `macrocounty`, and `region` placetypes.

Mesoshapes are a product of Mapzen.
