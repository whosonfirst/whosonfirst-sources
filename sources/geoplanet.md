### GeoPlanet

Properties with the `gp` prefix are from GeoPlanet. 

Sometimes the `woe` prefix is used instead because GeoPlanet supersedes Where on Earth (WOE) and not all data has been updated.

**Examples:** `gp:id` for GeoPlanet identifier concordance, and localized names (eg: `name:chi_p`, `name:ger_p`, and `name:kor_p`).
